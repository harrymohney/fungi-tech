# Fungi-Tech

Grow tracking app that allows users to record isolated grow methods. The user may choose between strains, grow methods and components of the grow. The user will have the ability to customize their grow and track the yields to discover the optimal method for each strain. Secondary use will be user referencing past grows to gauge progress.

# Getting Started

### Trello Board
- https://trello.com/b/KUNfi4NN/fungi-tech 
### App Link
- https://fungi-tech-q2tn9rgnv-harrymohney.vercel.app/


1. Open app: Strain List, View Details or create a new Strain 
2. Input Strain: name, description, imageUrl, strainUrl →  Add Strain
3. Delete Strain is active

# Application Features
1. When a user chooses the strain they can view details, delete, or create a new strain: 
    - the app has very basic functionality, but will store the data added

- As a user, I want an organized way to keep track of my mushroom genetics so I can manage their progress and avoid expiration.
- As a user, I would like a database of genetics I have stored and the ability to fetch information about the strain.

# Future Application Updates

- As a user, I’d like to store information about grow cycles on specific strains of mushrooms - humidity, temp, times, yield, light cycle, input (substrate, inoculation, fruiting times).
